## User Experience Flow

### 1. FAB Interaction (Updated - Direct Booking)

2. User fills in required fields:
   - Court/Field selection (dropdown)
   - Start and end time (datetime pickers)
   - Booking title
   - Player information (minimum 1, maximum 4 players)
   - Phone numbers for each player
3. Form validates in real-time with visual feedback
4. User clicks "Create Booking" to submit
5. Modal closes and calendar refreshes

### 3. Form Validation

- **Court Selection**: Required field
- **Time Selection**: Start time must be before end time, minimum 30 minutes
- **Booking Title**: Required field
- **Players**: Minimum 1 player required, maximum 4 allowed
- **Phone Numbers**: Indonesian phone number format validation
- **Visual Feedback**: Red borders and error messages for invalid fields

## Integration Points

```

### Calendar Integration
