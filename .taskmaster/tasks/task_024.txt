# Task ID: 24
# Title: Create Admin Onboarding Flow - Credentials Verification and Security Checks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 5, 4, 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement Step 1 of admin onboarding with secure credentials verification, role validation, and security checks before granting admin access.
# Details:
Create AdminOnboardingStep1.vue component that handles the initial admin verification process:

1. **Credentials Verification Form**:
   - Create secure login form specifically for admin access
   - Implement email/password validation with enhanced security requirements
   - Use Back4App authentication with Parse.User.logIn() for admin users

2. **Role Verification Logic**:
   - After successful login, verify user has 'admin' role in Parse User object
   - Implement role-based access control - redirect non-admin users to appropriate dashboards
   - Create custom Parse Cloud Function to validate admin privileges if needed

3. **Security Checks**:
   - Implement IP whitelisting/geolocation validation for admin access
   - Add two-factor authentication readiness (placeholder for future implementation)
   - Implement session timeout and security logging for admin activities
   - Validate admin account status (active/suspended) before proceeding

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Create specific error messages for admin authentication failures
   - Implement brute force protection with login attempt tracking
   - Handle network connectivity issues gracefully

5. **UI/UX**:
   - Design professional admin login interface with MaBar branding
   - Include loading states and success/error feedback
   - Implement responsive design for mobile admin access

Use Tailwind CSS for styling and ensure all security best practices are followed for admin authentication.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test admin authentication: Verify successful login with valid admin credentials and proper role verification
2. Test security validation: Attempt login with non-admin credentials and verify redirection to appropriate user dashboard
3. Test error handling: Verify proper error messages for invalid credentials, network issues, and role validation failures
4. Test security features: Verify IP validation (if implemented) and session timeout functionality
5. Test responsive design: Verify admin login works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
6. Test integration: Verify seamless transition to Step 2 (permissions setup) after successful verification
