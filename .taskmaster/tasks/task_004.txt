# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Profile Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user registration (email and OAuth SSO with Google and Facebook), login, role selection (Player or Venue Owner), and editable player profile with matchmaking preferences.
# Details:
Backend authentication implemented in Rust using oauth2 and jsonwebtoken crates for OAuth SSO and JWT token management. Use Actix Web or Axum framework with MongoDB integration via the official Rust driver. Store user data in MongoDB with roles and nested profile object including skill level, play style, and availability. Implement frontend registration/login forms and profile management pages with React Hook Form and validation. Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration and login flows for email and OAuth. Verify role selection persists. Edit and save profile preferences and confirm data updates in DB. Test authentication middleware protects routes. Validate Rust backend integration with MongoDB and JWT token generation/verification.
