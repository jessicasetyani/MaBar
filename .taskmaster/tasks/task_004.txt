# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Google Gemini AI for Chat-Based Matchmaking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Google Gemini API to enable AI-powered conversational matchmaking that understands complex criteria and provides player and venue recommendations.
# Details:
Use Google Gemini API with REST or gRPC. Implement backend middleware to handle chat sessions and parse user input. Design prompt engineering to include skill level, age, location, time, gender, frequency, history, and price. Cache frequent queries for performance. Frontend chat UI with real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI responses for various user queries. Validate recommendation relevance and correctness. Load test chat API for responsiveness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Obtain and Configure Google Gemini API Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Google AI Studio account, generate a Gemini API key, and configure environment variables for secure API access.
### Details:
Sign in to Google AI Studio, create or use an existing account, generate the Gemini API key, and set it as an environment variable (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY) for secure usage in backend services.

## 2. Design Backend Middleware for Chat Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement backend middleware to handle chat sessions, manage user inputs, and maintain conversational state.
### Details:
Develop middleware that manages chat session lifecycle, parses and sanitizes user inputs, and interfaces with the Gemini API to send and receive conversational data.

## 3. Develop Prompt Engineering Strategy for Matchmaking Criteria [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Design and implement prompt templates that incorporate matchmaking criteria such as skill level, age, location, time, gender, frequency, history, and price.
### Details:
Create dynamic prompt templates that effectively communicate user matchmaking preferences to the Gemini API, ensuring accurate and relevant AI responses.

## 4. Integrate Gemini API Calls Using REST or gRPC [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Implement API client integration to communicate with Google Gemini API using REST or gRPC protocols.
### Details:
Develop API client modules to send requests and handle responses from Gemini API, supporting both REST and gRPC as needed for flexibility and performance.

## 5. Implement Caching Layer for Frequent Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Design and implement a caching mechanism to store frequent matchmaking queries and their AI responses to improve performance.
### Details:
Use an in-memory or distributed cache to store and retrieve frequent query results, reducing API call volume and latency.

## 6. Develop Frontend Chat UI with Real-Time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create a responsive chat interface that supports real-time messaging and displays AI matchmaking recommendations dynamically.
### Details:
Implement frontend components for chat input, message display, and real-time updates using WebSockets or similar technologies to provide seamless user experience.

## 7. Test and Validate AI Matchmaking Responses and System Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of AI responses for accuracy, relevance, and system responsiveness under load.
### Details:
Test AI-generated matchmaking recommendations against diverse user queries, validate correctness of player and venue suggestions, and conduct load testing on chat API endpoints.
