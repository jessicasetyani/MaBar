# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Reputation System for Players and Venues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 11, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive reputation tracking system that monitors player reliability (no-show rates), venue quality ratings, and provides admin tools for managing reputation scores and handling violations according to community health KPIs.
# Details:
Create a reputation management system using Back4App Parse Server with the following components:

1. **Player Reputation Tracking**:
   - Store player attendance history with session IDs and status (attended/no-show)
   - Calculate no-show rate percentage based on last 10 sessions
   - Implement reputation scoring algorithm (e.g., 5-star system based on attendance reliability)
   - Store reputation data in Parse User object with custom fields: reputationScore, totalSessions, noShowCount, lastUpdated

2. **Venue Quality Rating System**:
   - Create venue rating collection with fields: venueId, userId, rating (1-5), reviewText, timestamp
   - Calculate average rating for each venue
   - Support rating submission after completed sessions
   - Store aggregated venue ratings in Venue object

3. **Admin Reputation Management Tools**:
   - Create admin dashboard with reputation management interface
   - Implement violation reporting system with severity levels
   - Add manual reputation adjustment capabilities
   - Create automated reputation decay system (scores decrease over inactivity)
   - Implement notification system for reputation threshold breaches

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Use Cloud Code functions for reputation calculations
   - Create BeforeSave triggers to update reputation scores automatically
   - Implement real-time reputation updates using Parse LiveQuery
   - Create Vue components for rating submission and reputation display
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive admin interface

Best Practices:
- Use weighted averages for recent behavior (more weight to recent sessions)
- Implement rate limiting for rating submissions
- Add fraud detection for fake reviews
- Ensure data privacy compliance for reputation data
- Create backup system for reputation scores

# Test Strategy:
Test the reputation system with the following scenarios:

1. **Player Reputation Tests**:
   - Verify no-show rate calculation accuracy with various session histories
   - Test reputation score updates after session completion
   - Verify reputation decay after periods of inactivity
   - Test threshold notifications for poor reputation scores

2. **Venue Rating Tests**:
   - Test rating submission workflow after completed sessions
   - Verify average rating calculations with multiple submissions
   - Test rating validation (1-5 stars, required fields)
   - Verify rating display in venue profiles

3. **Admin Tools Tests**:
   - Test manual reputation adjustment functionality
   - Verify violation reporting and handling workflow
   - Test reputation dashboard data accuracy
   - Verify admin permission checks for reputation management

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test reputation impact on matchmaking algorithms
   - Verify reputation data persistence across sessions
   - Test real-time reputation updates
   - Verify data consistency between User and Session objects

Use Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing of the reputation workflow.
