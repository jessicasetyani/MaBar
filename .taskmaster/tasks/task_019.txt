# Task ID: 19
# Title: Build Admin Dashboard for Venue Verification and User Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive admin dashboard for venue approval, user role management, and platform health monitoring with KPI tracking
# Details:
Create Vue.js admin dashboard component with three main sections:

1. Venue Verification Panel:
   - Display pending venue registrations from Task 12 with owner details, documents, and verification status
   - Implement approve/reject functionality with status updates in Parse
   - Create audit trail for verification actions with timestamps and admin user

2. User Management Panel:
   - Display user list with filtering by role (player/venue_owner/admin)
   - Implement role assignment functionality with dropdown selectors
   - Show user activity metrics (sessions joined, bookings made)
   - Include user suspension/reactivation capabilities

3. Platform Health Dashboard:
   - Display KPIs from PRD: no-show rates, venue violations, session completion rates
   - Implement data visualization using Chart.js for trend analysis
   - Show real-time metrics with date range filtering
   - Create violation reporting system with severity levels

Technical Implementation:
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) middleware to restrict admin access
- Create Parse queries for venue verification status and user management
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive dashboard layout with grid system
- Implement real-time data updates using Parse Live Queries for admin notifications
- Add search and filtering capabilities across all panels
- Create admin audit log in Parse for all administrative actions

Security Considerations:
- Implement server-side validation for all admin actions via Cloud Code
- Restrict admin routes to users with admin role only
- Validate user permissions before allowing role changes
- Encrypt sensitive admin operations in database

# Test Strategy:
1. Test venue verification workflow: Submit venue registration (Task 12), verify admin dashboard displays pending venues, test approve/reject functionality, confirm status updates in Parse
2. Test user role management: Create test users, verify role assignment functionality, test access control changes
3. Test platform health metrics: Generate test data (sessions, bookings, no-shows), verify KPI calculations accuracy, test date range filtering
4. Test security: Attempt unauthorized admin access, verify RBAC prevents access, test server-side validation of admin actions
5. Test responsiveness: Verify dashboard works on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
6. Test real-time updates: Verify Live Queries update dashboard when venue status changes or new violations occur
7. Test search and filtering: Verify all panels support search functionality and filter correctly
