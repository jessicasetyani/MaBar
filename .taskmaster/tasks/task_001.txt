# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure for frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js + Express.js). Setup MongoDB connection and environment configuration for development and production.
# Details:
Use React 18+ with Vite or Create React App for frontend setup. Backend with Node.js 18+ and Express 4.x. Use Mongoose 6.x for MongoDB ODM. Setup environment variables for OAuth credentials, Google Gemini API keys, and database URIs. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Setup GitHub repository with branch protections.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository initialization by running frontend and backend servers locally. Test MongoDB connection with a simple query. Validate environment variables loading. Run lint and format checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created and initialized the Git repository with proper `.gitignore` and branch structure.
### Details:
Created a new GitHub repository, configured branch protections for `main` and `development` branches, and added a comprehensive `.gitignore` file. Project structure organized as a monorepo with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.

## 2. Setup Frontend with React 18+ and Vite [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created a new React 18+ project using Vite, installed dependencies, and configured initial code quality tools.
### Details:
Used `npm create vite@latest` to initialize a React project, installed all necessary frontend dependencies, and configured ESLint and Prettier for the frontend.

## 3. Configure Backend with Node.js 18+ and Express 4.x [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Node.js + Express 4.x server with essential middleware, security, and error handling.
### Details:
Initialized a Node.js project, installed Express.js, configured basic middleware, implemented security best practices, and set up global error handling. The backend API server runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 4. Setup MongoDB Connection with Mongoose 6.x [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configured MongoDB connection using Mongoose and prepared a database setup script.
### Details:
Installed Mongoose 6.x, connected to a MongoDB database, and created a database setup script including collection definitions and index creation.

## 5. Configure Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created a comprehensive `.env` setup for all required environment variables.
### Details:
Implemented a `.env` file structure to manage environment variables for OAuth credentials, JWT secrets, Google Gemini API keys, and database URIs for development.

## 6. Configure ESLint and Prettier for Frontend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configured ESLint and Prettier for the frontend application to maintain code quality and consistency.
### Details:
Installed ESLint and Prettier within the `frontend/` directory, configured their settings for React/TypeScript, and added lint/format scripts to `frontend/package.json`.

## 7. Implement Local Development Configuration for Portfolio Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure optimized local development environment for portfolio demonstration, including build scripts and documentation for local-only deployment.
### Details:
Since this is a portfolio project for local development only, configured optimized build scripts, environment documentation, and local deployment instructions. Added production-like build process that can be demonstrated locally without external deployment.

## 8. Verify Project Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verified that the core project setup is complete and functional, including combined development workflow.
### Details:
Confirmed frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`, backend API server on `http://localhost:5000`, and the `/api/health` endpoint responds correctly. Verified linting and code formatting pass. Confirmed the combined development script (`concurrently`) runs both servers concurrently.

## 9. Configure ESLint and Prettier for Backend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up ESLint and Prettier for the backend Node.js + Express.js codebase with appropriate rules and scripts.
### Details:
Installed ESLint and Prettier in the `backend/` directory, configured rules appropriate for Node.js/Express environment, and added lint/format scripts to `backend/package.json`. Configuration includes Node.js best practices and consistent code formatting.
