# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Successfully initialized the project repository with a monorepo structure for frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js + Express.js). MongoDB connection and comprehensive environment configuration are set up. The development environment is fully functional and ready for feature implementation.
# Details:
React 18+ with Vite, Node.js 18+ and Express 4.x, Mongoose 6.x for MongoDB ODM. Comprehensive environment variables for OAuth, JWT, and API keys are configured. ESLint and Prettier are set up for frontend. Project organized as a monorepo with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories. `concurrently` is configured for running both servers. README.md is updated with installation and usage instructions.

# Test Strategy:
Verified frontend dev server runs successfully on `http://localhost:5173`. Backend API server runs successfully on `http://localhost:5000` and the health check endpoint `/api/health` responds correctly. Linting passes with no errors for frontend code. Code formatting works correctly. The combined development script runs both servers concurrently. Database setup script is ready (requires MongoDB to be running).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created and initialized the Git repository with proper `.gitignore` and branch structure.
### Details:
Created a new GitHub repository, configured branch protections for `main` and `development` branches, and added a comprehensive `.gitignore` file. Project structure organized as a monorepo with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.

## 2. Setup Frontend with React 18+ and Vite [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created a new React 18+ project using Vite, installed dependencies, and configured initial code quality tools.
### Details:
Used `npm create vite@latest` to initialize a React project, installed all necessary frontend dependencies, and configured ESLint and Prettier for the frontend.

## 3. Configure Backend with Node.js 18+ and Express 4.x [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Node.js + Express 4.x server with essential middleware, security, and error handling.
### Details:
Initialized a Node.js project, installed Express.js, configured basic middleware, implemented security best practices, and set up global error handling. The backend API server runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 4. Setup MongoDB Connection with Mongoose 6.x [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configured MongoDB connection using Mongoose and prepared a database setup script.
### Details:
Installed Mongoose 6.x, connected to a MongoDB database, and created a database setup script including collection definitions and index creation.

## 5. Configure Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created a comprehensive `.env` setup for all required environment variables.
### Details:
Implemented a `.env` file structure to manage environment variables for OAuth credentials, JWT secrets, Google Gemini API keys, and database URIs for development.

## 6. Configure ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configured ESLint and Prettier for the frontend application to maintain code quality and consistency.
### Details:
Installed ESLint and Prettier within the `frontend/` directory, configured their settings for React/TypeScript, and added lint/format scripts to `frontend/package.json`.

## 7. Implement Local Development Configuration for Portfolio Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure optimized local development environment for portfolio demonstration, including build scripts and documentation for local-only deployment.
### Details:
Since this is a portfolio project for local development only, configured optimized build scripts, environment documentation, and local deployment instructions. Added production-like build process that can be demonstrated locally without external deployment.

## 8. Verify Project Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verified that the core project setup is complete and functional, including combined development workflow.
### Details:
Confirmed frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`, backend API server on `http://localhost:5000`, and the `/api/health` endpoint responds correctly. Verified linting and code formatting pass. Confirmed the combined development script (`concurrently`) runs both servers concurrently.

## 9. Configure ESLint and Prettier for Backend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up ESLint and Prettier for the backend Node.js + Express.js codebase with appropriate rules and scripts.
### Details:
Installed ESLint and Prettier in the `backend/` directory, configured rules appropriate for Node.js/Express environment, and added lint/format scripts to `backend/package.json`. Configuration includes Node.js best practices and consistent code formatting.
