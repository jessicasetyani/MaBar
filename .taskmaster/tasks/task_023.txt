# Task ID: 23
# Title: Build Venue Owner Onboarding Multi-Step Form
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 5, 4, 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive multi-step onboarding form for venue owners with personal information, venue details, legal documents, document upload, and verification status tracking.
# Details:
Create VenueOwnerOnboarding.vue component with:

1. Multi-step form structure using Vue transitions with progress indicator (5 steps)
2. Step 1 - Personal Information: Name (required), Email (required with validation)
3. Step 2 - Venue Details: Venue name (required), address (with Google Maps integration), facilities checklist (court types, amenities)
4. Step 3 - Legal Documents: NIK number (validation), SIUP number (validation), contact number (phone validation)
5. Step 4 - Document Upload: File upload component for legal documents (max 5 files, PDF/JPEG/PNG only, max 5MB each) with drag-and-drop functionality
6. Step 5 - Pending Verification: Status page showing verification pending with estimated timeline and next steps

Implement form validation for each step using Vuelidate or similar. Store onboarding data in Parse with status tracking ('pending_verification'). Create file upload service that handles document storage in Back4App. Implement automatic status updates when documents are uploaded.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test multi-step navigation: Verify progress indicator updates correctly through all 5 steps
2. Test form validation: Validate required fields, email format, phone number validation, and file type/size restrictions
3. Test file upload: Upload various document types and verify they are stored correctly in Back4App
4. Test data persistence: Complete entire onboarding flow and verify all data is saved to Parse with correct status
5. Test verification status: Verify the pending verification page displays correctly after submission
