# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement QR Code Check-in Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the ability for players to scan QR codes to prove attendance at game sessions, enabling attendance verification.
# Details:
Use a React QR code scanner library like 'react-qr-reader' 3.x for frontend scanning. Backend API implemented in Rust with Actix Web or Axum framework to validate scanned QR code data, update player check-in status in GameSession. Secure endpoints to prevent spoofing. Provide UI feedback on successful or failed check-in.

# Test Strategy:
Test scanning QR codes with various devices. Verify backend updates check-in status correctly. Test error handling for invalid or duplicate scans.
