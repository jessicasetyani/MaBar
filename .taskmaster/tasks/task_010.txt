# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate AI Chat Interface with Google Gemini API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop frontend chat interface and backend API integration with Google Gemini API for conversational matchmaking in English and Bahasa Indonesia.
# Details:
Frontend chat UI with React using a chat component library or custom implementation supporting multilingual input. Backend API implemented in Rust with Actix Web or Axum framework to send user queries to Google Gemini API with proper prompt engineering and caching for common queries to reduce costs. Handle API responses and display matchmaking recommendations. Implement fallback deterministic filters for initial MVP. Use Google Gemini API latest version with secure API key management.

# Test Strategy:
Test chat interface usability and responsiveness. Validate API calls and responses. Confirm recommendations are relevant and multilingual support works. Test caching and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Google Gemini API Integration Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement backend API endpoints in Rust using Actix Web or Axum framework to handle requests to Google Gemini API with secure API key management and proper error handling.
### Details:
Create a new Rust module for Gemini API integration. Use reqwest or similar HTTP client to send requests to Gemini API. Securely manage API keys using environment variables (referencing Task 11 for secret management). Implement endpoints to accept user queries, format them for Gemini API, and return responses. Handle API errors and rate limiting.

## 2. Implement Prompt Engineering for Matchmaking [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop and refine prompts for Google Gemini API to generate conversational matchmaking recommendations in English and Bahasa Indonesia.
### Details:
Design prompts that guide Gemini to understand user preferences for matchmaking (e.g., sport type, skill level, location). Include examples in both English and Bahasa Indonesia. Implement prompt formatting in the backend, ensuring language context is passed correctly. Test with various inputs to optimize recommendation quality.

## 3. Build Multilingual Frontend Chat Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop React-based chat UI component supporting input and display in English and Bahasa Indonesia, integrated with backend API.
### Details:
Create a chat component using a library like react-chat-ui or custom implementation. Support text input and message display in both languages. Integrate with backend endpoints from 10.1 to send queries and receive responses. Implement language toggle or detection. Ensure responsive design and accessibility.

## 4. Implement Caching System for Common Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Add caching mechanism to backend to store and reuse common Gemini API responses, reducing API calls and costs.
### Details:
Use a caching library like redis or in-memory cache in Rust. Cache responses based on query text and language. Set appropriate TTL for cache entries. Implement cache lookup before making Gemini API calls. Ensure cache invalidation on relevant changes.

## 5. Develop Fallback Deterministic Filters [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create fallback logic for matchmaking when Gemini API is unavailable or returns errors, using deterministic rules for initial MVP.
### Details:
Implement fallback filters based on simple rules (e.g., filter by sport type, location, or time). Use these when API calls fail or return low-confidence results. Integrate fallback with main response handling to ensure seamless user experience.

## 6. Integrate and Test Full Chat Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Connect all components end-to-end, test multilingual chat, recommendations, caching, and fallbacks in integrated environment.
### Details:
Ensure frontend chat UI correctly calls backend API, which uses Gemini integration, caching, and fallbacks. Test complete flow in both languages. Validate recommendation display and error handling. Perform integration testing with real Gemini API (using test key).
