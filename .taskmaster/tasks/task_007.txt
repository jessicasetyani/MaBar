# Task ID: 7
# Title: Generate Unique QR Codes for Each Booking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement QR code generation for game sessions accessible from the venue dashboard to facilitate check-ins.
# Details:
Use a Rust QR code library like 'qrcode' or 'qrcode-generator' for backend generation. Each QR code encodes a unique session and player identifier. Store QR code data or generate on-demand. Integrate QR code display in venue dashboard and player session views using React frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Generate QR codes for sessions and verify scannability with standard QR scanners. Confirm QR codes encode correct session/player info. Test UI integration and accessibility.
