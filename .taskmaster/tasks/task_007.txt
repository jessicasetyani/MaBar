# Task ID: 7
# Title: Generate Unique QR Codes for Each Booking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement QR code generation for game sessions accessible from the venue dashboard to facilitate check-ins.
# Details:
Use a Rust QR code library like 'qrcode' or 'qrcode-generator' for backend generation. Each QR code encodes a unique session and player identifier. Store QR code data or generate on-demand. Integrate QR code display in venue dashboard and player session views using React frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Generate QR codes for sessions and verify scannability with standard QR scanners. Confirm QR codes encode correct session/player info. Test UI integration and accessibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate QR Code Library and Define QR Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the QR code generation library to the Rust backend and define the data structure for encoding session and player identifiers in QR codes.
### Details:
Add 'qrcode' or 'qrcode-generator' crate to Cargo.toml. Define a struct or function that takes session_id and player_id as input and formats them into a string (e.g., JSON or delimited format) for QR encoding. Ensure the data structure is consistent and easily parsable.

## 2. Implement Backend QR Code Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint in Rust that generates QR code images on-demand for a given session and player combination.
### Details:
Using Actix Web or Axum, create a GET endpoint (e.g., /api/sessions/{session_id}/players/{player_id}/qrcode) that uses the QR library to generate a PNG or SVG image. The endpoint should encode the structured data from subtask 7.1 into the QR code and return the image with appropriate content-type headers.

## 3. Add QR Code Display to Venue Dashboard in React [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Integrate the QR code display into the venue dashboard React component, fetching and showing QR codes for relevant sessions.
### Details:
In the venue dashboard React component (from task 5), add a section or modal to display QR codes for selected sessions. Use fetch or axios to call the backend endpoint from subtask 7.2 and render the QR image using an <img> tag with the src set to the endpoint URL.

## 4. Add QR Code Display to Player Session View in React [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Integrate the QR code display into the player session view React component, allowing players to access their session QR codes.
### Details:
In the player session view React component, add a section to display the QR code for the player's booking. Fetch the QR code from the backend endpoint (subtask 7.2) using the session_id and player_id, and render it in the UI. Ensure proper error handling if the QR code cannot be generated.
