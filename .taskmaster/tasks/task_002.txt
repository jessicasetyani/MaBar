# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication with OAuth 2.0 SSO
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure user authentication for Players and Venue Owners using OAuth 2.0 with Google and Facebook sign-in providers.
# Details:
Use Passport.js with passport-google-oauth20 and passport-facebook strategies. Store user profiles in MongoDB with roles (Player, Venue Owner). Secure JWT or session management for frontend-backend communication. Ensure secure token storage on client side (HttpOnly cookies or secure storage).

# Test Strategy:
Test login flows for each provider on both iOS and Android devices. Verify user data is stored correctly and roles assigned. Test logout and token expiration handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Dependencies and Set Up Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Successfully installed Passport.js, OAuth strategies (passport-google-oauth20, passport-facebook), and configured Express.js session management with MongoDB store.
### Details:
Installed passport, passport-google-oauth20, passport-facebook, express-session, connect-mongo, cookie-parser, jsonwebtoken, and bcryptjs. Configured Express.js with session management using MongoDB store and cookie parsing middleware.
