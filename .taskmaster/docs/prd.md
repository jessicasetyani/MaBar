Product Requirements Document: MaBar (v4.3 - Frontend Focus with Back4App)Status: Ready for DevelopmentLast Updated: August 30, 20251. Introduction & BackgroundMaBar is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to be the premier smart matchmaking platform for Padel players in Jakarta. This project focuses entirely on building a sophisticated frontend application, utilizing Back4App as a comprehensive backend service. The application connects players and courts through a conversational AI, aiming to provide personalized recommendations and foster a reliable community.2. Problem StatementPadel players in Jakarta face significant challenges in organizing games. Key problems include:Fragmented Discovery: Difficulty in simultaneously finding available courts and compatible playing partners.Inefficient Coordination: Over-reliance on unstructured WhatsApp groups leads to confusion.Skill & Quality Uncertainty: Lack of a standardized way to assess a player's skill or a venue's quality.Low Commitment & Reliability: Player no-shows and last-minute cancellations ruin the experience.3. Goals & ObjectivesOur primary business objective is to become the primary community and booking platform for Padel players in Jakarta.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for First Quarter Post-LaunchMetricKPIGoalPlatform AdoptionNumber of Successful Bookings per WeekStart at 10 in Week 1, and grow by at least 10 bookings each subsequent week.User GrowthMonthly Active Users (MAU)Achieve positive month-over-month growth in registered and active users.Community HealthNo-Show Rate & Venue Violation RateTrack and aim for a consistent decrease in the percentage of affected sessions.4. Target AudienceThe Committed Player: An active Padel player who needs a reliable way to find skilled partners and a simple, trustworthy booking process.The Venue Owner: Manages a Padel court in Jakarta and needs a simple tool to manage schedules and reduce administrative overhead.5. Features & RequirementsEPIC 1: User Onboarding & Profile ManagementUser StoryAcceptance Criteria (AC) & Dev Notes1.1: As a new User, I want to register and log in with my email and password.AC 1: User authenticates using Back4App's user management system. <br> AC 2: After the first login, the user is prompted to choose their primary role: "Player" or "Venue Owner". <br> AC 3: The system saves this role, and all subsequent logins automatically redirect the user to the correct dashboard.1.2: As a Player, I want a quick onboarding to set my initial preferences.AC 1: The user manually enters their Name and Email. <br> AC 2: Onboarding includes a mandatory skill self-assessment and setting key preferences. <br> Dev Note: The skill assessment will have three categories: 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'. The user will also select a 'Play Style' ('Casual' or 'Competitive').1.3: As a Player, I want an advanced profile page to refine my matchmaking criteria.AC 1: Profile includes editable fields for Weekly Availability, Budget, Play Style (Fun/Competitive), and Opponent Preferences (Gender/Age).EPIC 2: AI-Powered Matchmaking & BookingUser StoryAcceptance Criteria (AC) & Dev Notes2.1: As a Player, I want to use an AI Chat to find a game using natural language.AC 1: The AI Chat is the primary feature on the player dashboard. <br> AC 2: The AI uses the user's explicit request and their saved profile preferences to generate recommendations. <br> Dev Note: The Gemini API call will be handled securely via a Back4App Cloud Code Function. The frontend will call this function, which then communicates with the Gemini API. The AI must parse both English and Bahasa Indonesia.2.2: As a Player, I want to create or join a game session.AC 1: A player can create a session with a set minimum number of required players. <br> AC 2: The session is automatically cancelled if the minimum player count is not met by the "commitment deadline" (2 hours before start time). This logic will be implemented in a Back4App Cloud Code Job.EPIC 3: Venue ManagementUser StoryAcceptance Criteria (AC) & Dev Notes3.1: As a Venue Owner, I want a simple onboarding to list and verify my venue.AC 1: Onboarding requires venue info, contact number, NIK, and SIUP number. <br> AC 2: After submitting, the owner is taken to a "Pending Verification" page. <br> Dev Note: Venue verification will be manual. An admin user (with appropriate permissions in Back4App) will approve the venue via the Back4App Data Browser, which will trigger its visibility in the app.3.2: As a Venue Owner, I want a dashboard to manage my schedule and bookings.AC 1: The dashboard provides a calendar view of all MaBar bookings. <br> AC 2: The owner can manually block/unblock time slots to sync with their offline bookings.3.3: As a Venue Owner, I want to provide a QR code for player check-in.AC 1: A unique QR code is generated for each confirmed booking and is accessible from the venue dashboard.EPIC 4 & 5: Reputation and Admin Features are managed via Back4App roles and data browser.6. UI/UX Design PrinciplesAesthetic: The application will have a clean, modern, and minimalist design inspired by the provided visual references.User Experience: The interface must be intuitive and responsive. The PWA must function flawlessly on all common device screen sizes.Color Palette (Strict Guideline)RoleNameHex CodeUsagePrimaryMaBar Yellow#FDE047Primary buttons (e.g., "Book Now"), CTAs, and key highlights.BackgroundLight Cream#FEFCE8Main background color for most screens and components.SurfaceWhite#FFFFFFCards, modals, and input fields that need to stand out.TextCharcoal#334155All primary text, including headings and body copy.SubtleSlate Gray#64748BSecondary text, placeholder text, and inactive icons.AccentPadel Green#84CC16Secondary actions, success notifications, and active states.7. Technical Stack & ArchitectureArchitecture: A frontend-only PWA built with the Vue.js ecosystem. All backend services—including database, authentication, and serverless functions—will be provided by Back4App.Frontend Stack (Vue.js Ecosystem)Framework: Vue.js (for its intuitive structure and easy learning curve).Build Tool: Vite (for rapid project setup and development server).State Management: Pinia (a simple, ViewModel-like state management solution).Styling: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first, rapid UI development).API Client: Axios or the Back4App JavaScript SDK for making API requests.Backend as a Service (BaaS)Provider: Back4AppServices:Database: Managed Parse Server with a MongoDB backend.Authentication: Built-in User Management for email/password sign-up and login.Serverless Functions: Cloud Code Functions will be used to securely interact with the Google Gemini API and run scheduled jobs.8. Security & Code Quality StandardsSecurity: Environment ManagementThis practice is mandatory.Create a .env file: In the root of the Vue.js project, create a .env file for your Back4App keys.# .env file
VITE_BACK4APP_APP_ID="your_back4app_application_id"
VITE_BACK4APP_JAVASCRIPT_KEY="your_back4app_javascript_key"
API Key Security: The Google Gemini API Key must not be stored in the frontend code. It will be securely stored as an environment variable within the Back4App Cloud Code environment.Create a .gitignore file: Ensure the .env file and build artifacts (/dist) are included in the .gitignore.Code QualityLinting & Formatting: Use ESLint and Prettier (configured for Vue) to enforce consistent style.Test Coverage: A minimum test coverage threshold for the frontend application must be met using a framework like Vitest.9.
